# IFSG

Iterated Function System Generator is an interactive tool for creating and plotting the attractors of iterated function systems. 
It supports a number of different mappings of the Euclidean/Complex plane (similitude, affine, mobius, projective, and bilinear transformations).
It can help users to develop some intuition of IFS attractors, and is generally just a lot of fun to play around with.

I (Brendan Harding) originally developed this, in collaboration with Michael Barnsley and Louisa Barnsley, in 2011 using the Microsoft .NET Framework. 
This first implementation was included on a CD with the third (Dover) edition of Michael's textbook Fractals Everywhere.
Several years later the application was re-written using the Qt framework so that we could easily provide builds for multiple operating systems (and was also a good opportunity to re-engineer much of the code base).
IFSG was used for computer labs while teaching undergraduate courses in fractal geometry at the Australian National University over many years.
I also regularly use IFSG (or some customised derivatives) for mathematics outreach activities, particularly when engaging with high school students. 

Binaries for various platforms (Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu) are currently available via [this Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s58fi9cfnhuwyld/AAANhpBbGV7SYBkMtfGdxGUXa?dl=0).
You run this software at your own risk (i.e. the standard MIT License clause).
These builds are updated sporadically as the need arises.
Please get in touch if you run into any issues and I will endeavour to provide a prompt update.

At some point in the (hopefully) near future the source code will be made available here.
In the meantime, the source code will be made available on request.
